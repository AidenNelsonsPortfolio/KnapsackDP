--Built for CS340--

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The project has been built to find the optimal solution to the 
0/1 knapsack problem via a DP approach and a subproblem matrix
(taking Theta(n*W) space and time complexity).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

To begin this program, ensure that the project4.py file is in the 
same directory as the 'knapsack.txt' file that holds the number of 
items and the target weight on the first line, and then, on each 
subsequent line k, the weight and value of item k (in that order).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

To run the program, do the following command in the terminal, once 
you are inside of the directory containing the project4.py file.

        python project4.py

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Then, assuming that the directory also contains a 'knapsack.txt'
file as it is supposed to, the program will read in the values and 
compute the solutions table, before returning the ideal set of items 
to give the largest value output given the weight constraint. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

You will then be prompted if you want to choose a different weight
bound, and you can enter either 'y' (to enter a new weight bound)
or 'n' (to exit the program)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Depending upon your choice, you will either enter a new weight bound,
(which has to be greater than zero, by the way) which will recompute 
the solutions matrix and return the ideal set, or you will exit the 
program.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for using my KnapsackDP solution, I hope everything works well!

May God bless,
